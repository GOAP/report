\chapter{Aims and Objectives}
The aim of this project is to create a goal orientated action planning artificial intelligence(AI) agent. This agent should be able to asses its current status against its desired state. From this it should then generate an action plan, that it will then be able to execute in order to achieve the desired state. \newline

\begin{itemize}
	\item Design and Create a Survival Game
	\item Create an Artificial Intelligence Agent capable of making an action plan
	\item Create 
\end{itemize}

To demonstrate this we set ourselves the objectives of designing and creating a survival game in which the main character is our AI agent.
